![Design preview for the E-commerce product page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This repository contains my solution to the [E-commerce Product Page Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6) on Frontend Mentor. Through this project, I honed my skills in responsive web design, modular SCSS (Sass), and vanilla JavaScript by building a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing product page.

## 🛠 My Process

### 🧱 Built With

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup
- **Sass (SCSS)** – Modern CSS preprocessor
  - ✅ Variables
  - ✅ Nesting
  - ✅ Modules (`@use`)
  - ✅ Mixins (`@mixin`)
  - ✅ Extend (`@extend`)
- **CSS Flexbox & Grid** – Layout and alignment
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation & interactive behavior
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control

---

### ⚙️ Key Features

- Fully responsive layout across devices
- Interactive product image gallery with previous/next controls
- Lightbox modal for image preview
- Cart functionality with quantity controls and item removal
- Clean and scalable SCSS structure using modular design principles

---

### 💡 What I Learned

This challenge provided an excellent opportunity to enhance both my styling and scripting knowledge. Some key takeaways include:

- Structuring scalable styles using SCSS modules with `@use`
- Using `@mixin` and `@extend` to write cleaner and DRY CSS
- Leveraging nesting for contextual styling
- Implementing image sliders and lightbox modals using pure JavaScript
- Dynamically updating the DOM with `textContent`, `classList`, and custom event handling
- Writing JavaScript logic for quantity updates, cart visibility, and dynamic rendering

---

### 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

The page has been thoroughly optimized for mobile viewing:

- Responsive burger menu for navigation
- Fluid and adaptive lightbox behavior on smaller screens
- Smart stacking of layout elements for usability

---

### 🔄 Continued Development

Future improvements may include:

- Modularizing JavaScript using ES6 classes or components
- Adding persistent cart state using `localStorage`
- Improving accessibility (ARIA roles, focus trapping)
- Migrating to a framework like React for scalability
